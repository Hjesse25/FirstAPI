# FirstAPI
Web API that sorts through a group of books and performs CRUD on them with a database. I used the tutorial by Code a Future to learn: [Rest API Course](https://youtu.be/OI3_fFxeqg8?si=goDnp56V9qXjPfsr)

## How It's Made:
I used C#, SQL Server, and Entity Framework Core.

## Lessons Learned
I learned about how the API integrates with entity framework core and sql server.
